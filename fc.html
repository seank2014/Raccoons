                    <p class="contentwords"> The increasing number of raccoons in urban areas has resulted in diverse reactions in humans, ranging from annoyance of their presence to feeding them like stray cats and birds. Many wildlife experts and most public authorities caution against feeding wild animals because they might become increasingly obtrusive and dependent on humans as a food source. Raccoons without a fear of humans are a concern to those who attribute this trait to rabies, but scientists point out this behavior is much more likely to be a behavioral adjustment to living in habitats with regular contact to humans for many generations.[233] Raccoons usually do not prey on domestic cats and dogs, but there have been  cases of killings have been reported. While overturned waste containers and raided fruit trees are just a nuisance to homeowners, it can cost several thousand dollars to repair damage caused by the use of attic space as dens. Relocating or killing raccoons without a permit is forbidden in many urban areas on grounds of animal welfare. </p>
